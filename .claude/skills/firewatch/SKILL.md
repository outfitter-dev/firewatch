# Firewatch

Query, filter, and act on GitHub PR activity using the Firewatch CLI (`fw`).

## Quick Start

```bash
fw --refresh --summary --open    # Sync and see what needs attention
fw --type comment --prs 42       # Comments on PR #42
fw --type comment | jq 'select(.author != .pr_author)'  # External feedback only
```

## Core Concepts

### JSONL Output

Firewatch outputs one JSON object per line. Each entry is **denormalized** — it contains full PR context (title, state, author, labels) so you never need joins.

```bash
fw --type comment --limit 1
```

```json
{
  "id": "IC_kwDOK...",
  "type": "comment",
  "subtype": "review_comment",
  "author": "alice",
  "body": "Consider adding error handling here",
  "file": "src/auth.ts",
  "line": 42,
  "pr": 123,
  "pr_title": "Add user authentication",
  "pr_state": "open",
  "pr_author": "bob",
  "created_at": "2025-01-14T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Entry Types

| Type      | Subtype          | Meaning                                     |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `comment` | `review_comment` | Inline code comment (actionable)            |
| `comment` | `issue_comment`  | General PR comment                          |
| `review`  | —                | Review submission (approve/request changes) |
| `commit`  | —                | Commit pushed to PR branch                  |
| `ci`      | —                | CI/CD status check                          |
| `event`   | —                | Lifecycle event (opened, closed, merged)    |

## Querying

### Filter Flags

```bash
fw --type comment              # By type
fw --since 24h                 # By time (30s, 5m, 24h, 7d, 2w, 1mo)
fw --prs 42                    # By PR number
fw --author alice              # By author
fw --open                      # Open PRs only
fw --active                    # Open or draft PRs
fw --mine                      # PRs assigned to me
fw --reviews                   # PRs I need to review
```

Combine filters (AND logic):

```bash
fw --type review --author alice --since 7d --open
```

### Aggregation

Per-PR summary instead of individual entries:

```bash
fw --summary --open
```

### Composing with jq

CLI filters handle common cases; jq handles everything else:

```bash
# Only approved reviews
fw --type review | jq 'select(.state == "approved")'

# Comments mentioning "TODO"
fw --type comment | jq 'select(.body | test("TODO"; "i"))'

# External feedback (not self-comments)
fw --type comment | jq 'select(.author != .pr_author)'

# Count by type
fw | jq -s 'group_by(.type) | map({type: .[0].type, count: length})'
```

**Tip:** Use CLI filters first, then jq. CLI filters are faster because they skip JSON parsing for non-matching entries.

See [references/jq-cookbook.md](references/jq-cookbook.md) for more patterns.

## Taking Action

### Post a Comment

```bash
fw add 42 "LGTM, merging!"
```

### Reply to a Review Comment

Every comment entry has an `id` field:

```bash
fw add 42 "Fixed in latest commit" --reply IC_kwDOK...
```

### Reply and Resolve

```bash
fw add 42 "Done" --reply IC_kwDOK... --resolve
```

### Resolve Without Replying

```bash
fw close IC_kwDOK...
```

Resolve multiple threads:

```bash
fw close IC_abc IC_def IC_ghi
```

## Staleness Tracking

Review comments can become stale when the file is modified. Run `fw check` to populate staleness data:

```bash
fw check
```

Then query for unaddressed comments:

```bash
fw --type comment | jq 'select(.file_activity_after.modified == false)'
```

The `file_activity_after` field shows:

- `modified` — Whether file was changed after the comment
- `commits_touching_file` — How many commits touched the file
- `latest_commit` — SHA of the most recent commit to the file

## Graphite Stack Support

Firewatch integrates with Graphite for stack-aware queries. When syncing in a repo with Graphite stacks, entries include stack metadata:

```bash
fw --refresh   # Auto-detects Graphite stacks
```

### Stack Fields

Entries gain a `graphite` object:

```json
{
  "graphite": {
    "stack_id": "abc123",
    "stack_position": 2,
    "stack_size": 4,
    "parent_pr": 101
  }
}
```

- `stack_position` — 1 is the base (closest to main), higher = further up
- `file_provenance` — Which PR in the stack introduced each file

### Quick Stack Queries

```bash
# All entries with stack metadata
fw | jq 'select(.graphite != null)'

# Base PRs only (bottom of stack)
fw --summary | jq 'select(.graphite.stack_position == 1)'

# Comments where file originated in a different PR
fw --type comment | jq 'select(.file_provenance.origin_pr != .pr)'
```

### Stack Workflows

For detailed Graphite workflows (querying stacks, cross-PR fixes, commit patterns):

- [graphite/stack-queries.md](graphite/stack-queries.md) — Querying stack data
- [graphite/cross-pr-fixes.md](graphite/cross-pr-fixes.md) — File provenance and fixing in the right PR
- [graphite/commit-workflow.md](graphite/commit-workflow.md) — `gt modify` vs `gt amend -a`

## Agent Tips

1. **CLI filters first, then jq** — More efficient than jq-only filtering
2. **Denormalized = no joins** — Each entry has full PR context
3. **Entry IDs for actions** — Use `id` field with `--reply` and `fw close`
4. **Run `fw check` for staleness** — Populates `file_activity_after` field
5. **Check `.graphite` for stacks** — Null if not in a Graphite stack
6. **File provenance for cross-PR fixes** — See [graphite/cross-pr-fixes.md](graphite/cross-pr-fixes.md)
